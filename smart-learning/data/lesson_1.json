That means the weather never stays the same. But even though the weather changes, there are still weather patterns during certain times of the year. A pattern is something that repeats itself. For example, the weather pattern in the summer is mostly sunny and warm. Weather patterns may change a lot in some places, and very little in other places. It all depends on where you live on Earth.",

[Pause for students to respond.] Each season has its own special characteristics. Characteristics are ways we can describe and group things. Each season has things that make it different from the others. For example, a characteristic of summer is hot weather, and a characteristic of winter is snow. The seasons are different depending on where you live.Not all places get snow in the winter, and not all places are steaming hot in the summer.But one thing is for sure: no matter where you live, the seasons always change in the same order, year after year. When something happens over and over again in the same order, it’ s called a cycle.Every year the cycle of the seasons begins in winter, followed by spring, summer, autumn, and back to winter. I’ ll be talking about my hometown, Washington, D.C., a lot in my letters, but the characteristics of the four seasons where you live might be a little different.It will be fun to see if your weather is different from mine! I’ ll say good bye for now, but I will write again soon.Until then, I hope you are enjoying beautiful weather where you live! Your friend, Annie ",

The Teacher Guide for Seasons and Weather contains eight daily lessons, each of which is composed of two distinct parts, so that the lesson may be divided into smaller chunks of time and presented at different intervals during the day. Each entire lesson will require a total of sixty minutes. This domain includes a Pausing Point following Lesson 5, after all four seasons have been introduced. At the end of the domain, a Domain Review, a Domain Assessment, and Culminating Activities are included to allow time to review, reinforce, assess, and remediate content knowledge.

							"section_name": "Why Seasons and Weather are important ",
							"section_text": "This domain will introduce students to the concept of weather. Students will learn that different regions of Earth experience different weather patterns throughout the year. They will also learn that we can think about a year and the related weather patterns in terms of four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Students will also learn why knowing about the weather is important, and how weather affects our daily lives and activities. As the weather associated with each season varies depending upon where one lives, students throughout the United States will have different experiences with regard to the four seasons. There are, however, certain common seasonal features that will be true for all children living within the continental United States; for example, summer is always a warmer season, in general, than winter. The lessons and read-alouds included in this domain have been carefully written to make these common seasonal features clear, while still encouraging you to customize the discussions and subsequent activities to make students aware of the specific weather patterns in your area. Implicit in understanding the relationship between weather and seasons is having an understanding of time. Your student's grasp of the concepts discussed in this domain will be enhanced if they are already somewhat familiar with basic temporal concepts, such as day, week, month, and year. You will note that, within the lessons that follow, we recommend frequently referencing to a monthly calendar as a way of making the idea of time concrete. The kinds of directed observations and hands-on activities associated with documenting the daily weather—such as looking at a thermometer, examining precipitation collected in a rain gauge, or observing the types of clouds in the sky—will help students more fully grasp the concepts they will hear about in this domain.
