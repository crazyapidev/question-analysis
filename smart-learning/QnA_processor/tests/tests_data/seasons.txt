Hello! My name is Annie, and I live in a big city called Washington, D.C. I’m in fifth grade, but I remember when I was in kindergarten, just like you. Right now in school, my class islearning about seasons and weather. Seasons are different times of the year, and weather is the temperature and conditions outside. For my school project, I’m going to be your weather pen pal. I’m going to teach you what the weather is like where I live. I will also tell you about the weather in different areas, or places, on Earth. You can help me with my project by answering all my questions, so I can learn about what the seasons and weather are like where you live.

There are many different kinds of weather. There is sunny weather, cloudy weather, windy weather, rainy weather, and stormy weather. What is the weather like outside today where you live?

My teacher says that no matter where you live on Earth, the weather is always changing, hour by hour, and day by day. That means the weather never stays the same. But even though the weather changes, there are still weather patterns during certain times of the year. A pattern is something that repeats itself. For example, the weather pattern in the summer is mostly sunny and warm. Weather patterns may change a lot in some places, and very little in other places. It all depends on where you live on Earth

This is a map of the earth. I’ve colored two areas on the map blue. The color blue is often used to stand for things that are cold. One is at the North Pole and one is at the South Pole. Even though the North and South Poles are at opposite ends of the earth from each other, they share the same weather patterns. The weather pattern at the North and South Poles is always cold, and the land is usually covered by ice.

This is the South Pole, which is located on the continent of Antarctica. It is one of the coldest places on Earth. The ground is covered by ice all year long, though it almost never rains or snows here. The wind can be strong, and the temperature is freezing cold.

I have colored the middle area of this map red. The weather pattern in this area is usually very warm all year long. The biggest change in the weather during different times of the year is the amount of rain. 

During certain months in the rainforest, the day may start off warm and sunny, but by afternoon it may rain very, very hard. This weather pattern occurs almost every day! This area gets lots of rain and sun almost year- round. The rain and sun keep the plants and trees green and healthy

Do you see the part of this map that is colored green? This is most of the United States, the country where we live. Most of the United States is on the continent of North America, although the state of Hawaii is made up of islands located in the Pacific Ocean. In most of the United States, it’s not always cold, like at the North and South Poles, and its not always hot, like at the middle section of the earth. The weather in most of the United States changes with every season, so we get cold weather, hot weather, and everything in between.

There are four seasons in a year: winter, spring, summer, and autumn.  Here, the word seasons means the different times of the year. Each season has different weather so the weather in the United States   changes depending on where you live and which season it is. Plants, trees, grass, and flowers change in different seasons. You will also see different kinds of animals in different seasons.

This image shows the season called winter. Winter is the coldest season. In some places, snow and ice cover the ground during wintertime. Other places that do not have snow and ice are still colder in winter than inother seasons. Some animals, like ears, sleep during the winter season.

Eventually, winter ends and spring begins. spring, the sun shines a little longer and warmer each day, which melts the ice and snow. The snow and ice turn to water as the sun’s warmth gets stronger. In spring, new leaves appear on the trees, new plants grow up from the warming earth, and flowers bloom again. Many baby animals are born during the spring, too!

After spring comes summer. Summer is the hottest season of the year in the United States. Summer is the season in which all the plants are at their greenest—full of leaves, flowers, and fruit. Birds, bugs, and other animals are easiest to spot in the summer

Finally, after summer comes autumn. Autumn is also called fall. In most places in the United States, the leaves change colors and fall off certain types of trees in autumn. The air outside gets cooler and the sun shines a little less each day. Autumn is when farmers harvest their fruits and vegetables, birds fly south, and everyone gets ready for winter.

Let’s say the seasons together: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Do you know what season it is right now where you live? How do you know? [Pause for students to respond.] Each season has its own special characteristics. Characteristics are ways we can describe and group things. Each season has things that make it different from the others. For example, a characteristic of summer is hot weather, and a characteristic of winter is snow.

The seasons are different depending on where you live. Not all places get snow in the winter, and not all places are steaming hot in the summer. But one thing is for sure: no matter where you live, the seasons always change in the same order, year after year. When something happens over and over again in the same order, it’s called a cycle. Every year the cycle of the seasons begins in winter, followed by spring, summer, autumn, and back to winter
